# blueTeamSysinternals
Installs sysinternals and strips all attributes that would show sysinternals. This was developed for use during the ISTS competition to prevent the red tean from seeing what tools we were running.

The website where the executable files were located during the competition no longer exists. 

# How to use:
Open cmd and run the following command:

For 32-bit:
goodtoolsinstaller.bat 32

For 64-bit:
